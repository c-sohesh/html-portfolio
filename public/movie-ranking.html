<h1>The Best Animes According to Me</h1>

<h2>My top 3 animes of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>
    It's a anime about a pirate boy who wants to be The King of the Pirates.
    Adventerous, funny, motivational.
</p>

<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p>
    It is a anime in which there is a book. The writer can
    write the person's name and cause of death. It was my first anime.

<h3>HxH</h3>
<p>
    It's called Hunter X Hunter. I have not completed the whole anime yet but I like it so far.
